- [ ] for the variable query mode drop-down menu, add mouse hover and mouse
  click interaction
- [ ] escape key to deselect program

  `VariableQueryMode` to have two lists, one which is the unfiltered list of items
  from context, along with their `fitsInHole` status, and one which is the
  filtered list via the query

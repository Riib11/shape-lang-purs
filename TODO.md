  - [ ] syntax
    - [ ] upgrade lists to have metadata for each item
  - [ ] recursors
    - [x] base
    - [x] context + type
    - [x] metacontext (for derived metadata stuff: names, shadows, constructor
          ids, etc)
    - [ ] index (still have to handle typechanges)
  - [ ] index
    - [x] upgrade syntax/metadata so that lists have an `*ItemMetadata` for each
          element of the list
    - [x] upgrade index so that each step has constant number of children (lists
          have 2 children: head, tail)
    - [x] upgrade index recursor layer
    - [x] upgrade renderer
  - [ ] rendering
    - [x] basic outline
    - [x] indentation
    - [x] shadowing
      - [x] bug: paramter names in types not shadowing correctly, but lambdas
            do??
    - [ ] actions
    - [ ] cursor (worry about this after mouse actions work)

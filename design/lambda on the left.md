# Lambda on the left

## Proposal

Allow lambda on the left.

## Advantages 

Allows you to write lambda on the left.

## Disadvantages

- Why would you _ever_ write lambda on the left??
- Requires the ability to make an application (currently, you merely use a variable and then apply it to arguments when they exist)
- Requires app in term, which requires chTerm dealing with curried application. Currently, I haven't solved this problem.

## User interactions we want to support
- Block interactions
  - create/move/delete term definition within a block
  - create/move/delete data definition within a block
- Signature interactions
  - dig argument/output
  - add/move/delete argument
  - fill a type hole (which will always be in a declaration, thats where the types are)
- Term interactions
  - dig (Get turned into HoleTerm)
  - Hole
    - intro lambda (if hole's type is arrow)
    - paste/move term into hole
  - Application
    - add/delete argument
- Lambda interactions (we need these now as a result of having partial application)
  - In a hole ? of type A -> B, turn it to (lam a . ?) where the hole is now of type B
  - Turn (lam a . ?) into ?
  - Note that all other things that you might want to do with lambdas are already handled by "Signature interactions" above.
- Datatypes interactions
  - create/move/delete constructor

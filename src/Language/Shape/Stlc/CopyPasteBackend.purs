Next, its time to actually write the code that moves a definition.
There are three relevant indices: start, ancestor, and end.
It needs to:

call chAtIndex on subterm at "ancestor", and use ToReplace to insert term at "start"
This will require taking difference of "start" and "ancestor". Also, will need the context at "ancestor"
